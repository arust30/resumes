My Resumes
This repository contains three different resumes that I have created using LaTeX:

master_resume.tex: This is my general resume that includes all of my work experience, education, skills, and achievements.
pm_resume.tex: This is a resume specifically tailored for project management positions, highlighting my relevant skills and experience in that field.
swe_resume.tex: This is a resume specifically tailored for software engineering positions, highlighting my relevant skills and experience in that field.
